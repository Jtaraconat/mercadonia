# Mercadonia backend 

This is the backend of the app I made to validate my bachelor 
It's coded in JAVA
It features Spring security, JPA, JWT
The backend is connected to the react frontend 

The development of the app was smooth but I add a lot os issues to host the front and back on Heroku 
I always add an unauthorized error once hosted but everything worked great and as intended on localhost 

Overall this project helped me a lot to understand JAVA and spring and how everything is connected from front to back
